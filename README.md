# Wikipedika - A Self Generating Wikipedia

Wikipedika is a small project that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative models to create a self-generating Wikipedia-like platform. With Wikipedika, users can instantly generate Wikipedia like pages in real-time on any topic of interest.

## Features

- **Real-time Generation**: Wikipedika generates Wikipedia-like pages instantly, providing users with up-to-date information on any topic.
- **Quick Information**: Users can access quick summaries and key information on searched topics without the need to navigate through lengthy articles.
- **Visual Media Support**: Wikipedika incorporates imagesto enhance the user experience and provide comprehensive information.
- **Interactive Interface**: The user-friendly interface allows for seamless navigation and exploration of generated content.
- **Hyperlink Support**: We have implemented the support to search for words present in the page by selecting them and clicking the search button. This feature works synonymous to the hyperlink support in actual wikipedia

## How It Works

Wikipedika utilizes advanced language models and generative algorithms to dynamically generate Wikipedia-like pages. When a user searches for a topic, the system retrieves relevant information from various sources and synthesizes it into a coherent and informative page. The generated content is continuously updated to reflect the latest developments and changes in the topic.

## Getting Started

To get started with Wikipedika, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the application and navigate to the homepage.
3. Use the search functionality to explore different topics and generate Wikipedia-like pages instantly.
